# Jupyter-Function-Display
This is a TamperMonkey plugin. See https://www.tampermonkey.net for how to use it.
You can also run the js code in Developer Tools.

## Introduction

Display function definitions and return values in a floating window that can be closed. 

Navigate to the definition by clicking items in the list.

### Update v1.1:

Added display for return value. 

Due to a bug, **please quickly scroll through the whole page after refreshing** in order for the return values to show up.
